# Visual BASM

**BASM** is a [flavor of Assembly](https://github.com/tsoding/bm/blob/master/docs/assembly.md) for the [BM Virtual Machine](https://github.com/tsoding/bm)

This tool will be able to animate stack manipulation that are made by each instruction.

Currently it can interpret only [123i.basm](https://github.com/tsoding/bm/blob/master/examples/123i.basm) example.
